## Project Overview

IntelliKYC is an end-to-end solution built on the ServiceNow platform to solve the challenges of traditional, manual Know Your Customer (KYC) processes in the banking sector. Our solution digitizes and automates the entire KYC journey, transforming it from a slow, error-prone process into a fast, intelligent, and transparent experience for both customers and bank employees.

The primary goal is to drastically reduce the Turnaround Time (TAT) for new account openings, improve compliance through auditable workflows, and enhance the overall customer and agent experience.

## Key Features

- **Automated Risk Engine:** A custom script-based engine that calculates a risk score (Low, Medium, High) for each application in real-time.
- **Dynamic Workflows:** A multi-path Flow Designer orchestration that routes applications based on their calculated risk level, assigning different tasks and approval requirements for each path.
- **Conversational AI (Virtual Agent):** An innovative, user-friendly interface that allows customers to:
    - Submit a new KYC application through a guided conversation.
    - Check the real-time status of their application.
- **Agent Co-Pilot:** A Virtual Agent topic for bank agents to find urgent tasks (e.g., high-risk cases or those breaching deadlines), improving productivity.
- **Proactive Notifications:** A multi-channel system using both email and proactive Virtual Agent messages to keep customers and agents informed at every stage.
- **Centralized Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard with reports for managers to monitor the KYC pipeline, risk distribution, and task deadlines.
- **Auditable & Secure:** Every risk decision is logged in a dedicated audit table, and access to all data is controlled by role-based Access Control Lists (ACLs).
